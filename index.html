						We now ask, under what metric are two things similar? Well, we call spaces similar if they
						have the same <b>fundemental group</b>.
					</section>
					<section>
						Let us take some closed paths over the objects, that is we run around and take any path where we start 
						and end at the same point. Then the fundemental group is the collection of all these different 
						paths, up to homotopy. This has some sort of structure. This is what we call a group structure in maths. 
					</section>
					<section>
						A group has an idea of addition. To add paths we just line them up end to end,
						<video data-autoplay>
							<source data-src="./videos/homotopy_add.mp4" type="video/webm" />
						</video>
					</section>
					<section>Further, a group have the following structure,
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">
								<b>Closure</b> - Adding two paths makes another path.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								<b>Inverse</b> - to undo a path, run in the opposing direction
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								<b>Identity</b> - do nothing. This like adding zero.
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">
								A group also has <b>associativity</b>. That is, if you have three paths $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$
								then if you run $p_1$ then $p_2$ then $p_3$ that is the same as running $p_2$ then $p$
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/FG.mp4"></video> <!-- I want to remove the background and have a reverse -->
					</section>
					<section>
						The two paths of a circle are just running around in a forward direction and running around in a negative direction 
						or doing nothing. Hence, we have the path $1$, forward, $-1$, backwards and $0$, do nothing. This 
						forms a group. The fundemental group. This group is exactly the integers, $\mathbb{\Z} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots\}$.
						Hence $\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$.

						<h1>The Siefert-Van Kampen Theorem</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							We now introduce something that is a keystone idea in Algebraic Topology. The Siefert-Van Kampen Theorem.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Wedge Sum</li>
							<li class = "fragment">Siefert-Van Kampen</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						The wedge sum is defined as follows. Take two objects, then the wedge sum of these 
						two objects is just the two objects touching at a point. If $X$ and $Y$ are spaces, the 
						wedge sum is notated as,
						$$ X \vee Y $$
						
						<center><img src="./photos/Wedge_of_Two_Circles.png" alt="The Wedge Sum of two circles"></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						The Siefert-Van Kampen Theorem states that if we have space that is just a wedge sum, then the fundemental 
						group is just <b>some</b> product of the fundemental groups of both spaces,
						$$ \pi_1(X \vee Y) = \pi_1(X) * \pi_2(Y) $$
					</section>
					<section>
						So, the fundemental group of a figure eight is,
						$$ \pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) = \pi_1(S^1) * \pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} $$
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/figureEight.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						The fundemental group of a figure eight has four elements: $0$, do nothing, $A$ go around the left
						lobe, $B$ go around the right lobe and $X$ go around the whole figure. This is the free group on 
						two characters, we denote this as,
						$$ \langle A, B \rangle. $$
					</section>
					<section>
						We call the figure of eight, the 2-rose (a rose with two petals). If we consider roses with more petals, which
						parkruns usually are, we are going to have,
						$$ \begin{align*} \pi_1 (S^1 \vee S^1 \vee \dots \vee S^1) &= \pi_1(S^1) * \pi_1(S^1) * \dots * \pi_1(S^1) \\ &= \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} * \dots * \mathbb{Z} \end{align*}. $$ 
						This then becomes the free group on $n$ letters.

						<h1>ASIDE: COVERING SPACES</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						Here's a thing. You usually go around a track more than once on Parkrun, does this affect things?
						The answer is, it doesn't. You may ask me why? That's because of something we call covering spaces.
						<center><img src="./photos/coveringSpace.png" alt="A photo of the covering space"></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						Take your parkrun course and look at it as a slinky. When you pull it upwards you see something very similar to 
						the image on the last page. Now cut the slinky at the start of the course (if it overlaps) and then you will have 
						a few copies of one lap of the course. We are interested in the shape of a lap and so it doesn't matter!

						<h1>THERE ARE ONLY $N$ PARKRUN COURSES!</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						We are going to consider some parkrun courses up to homotopy. Here are some of the different parkrun courses, 
					</section>
					<section>
						The non-closed loop. Here we have a loop that contracts just back to a point. An example of this is my favourite 
						parkrun, Penrose Estate. 
						<center><img style="width: 40%" src="./photos/PenrosePR.png" alt="The track of penrose parkrun"></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/PenrosePR.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						A non-overlapping loop. This is *just* a circle. An example of this is Gunnersbury Parkrun,
						<center><img src="./photos/Gunnersbury.png" alt="The Gunnersbury parkrun route."></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/gunnersburyWhite.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						One crossing loop. This is a figure 8. An example of this is Heartlands Parkrun, my home parkrun. 
						<center><img style="width: 40%" src="./photos/Heartlands.png" alt="The Heartlands parkrun route"></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						Two crossing loop. This is a 3-rose. I have two nice examples here. Durlston Parkrun and The Forest of Dean
						parkrun. Firstly Durlston,
						<center><img style="width: 20%; " src="./photos/triPR1.png" alt="The route of Durlston Parkrun"></center>
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/DurlstonPR.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						and the Forest of Dean Parkrun,
						<center><img style="width: 60%" src="./photos/triPR2.png" alt=""></center></span>
					</section>
					<section>
						<video data-autoplay src="./videos/FoDPR.mp4"></video>
					</section>
					<section>
						This is where you come in. Is there a parkrun with three crossings? I checked for two hours and couldn't 
						find one. However, your parkrun may have one. If so, speak now. If not, I behold that there are only three 
						parkruns, $N=3$!
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section><h1>Conclusion</h1></section>
					<section>
						We have (very quickly) learnt about Algebraic Topology, one of my favourite parts of Maths. We have seen the 
						fundemental group and briefly seen the free product and free group. Here are a few conclusions,<br>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Maths is fun! It's not just sums.</li>
							<li class="fragment">The fundemental group is whacky</li>
							<li class="fragment">James doesn't like crunching data</li>
							<li class="fragment">James really need to learn blender.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Come back to the Maths Tent for more topology chats about this and knots.
